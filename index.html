  <p><strong>An Introduction</strong></p>
  <p>Hi, Hello and Good day, my name is Klarisa Arwena Anhar, and I'm a student in RMIT, I'm 18 years old &ndash; born on 1st of April 2004 &ndash; and I'm pursuing a degree in Information Technology, I graduated from high school not too long ago, so my educational background is limited (though I look forward to learning many new things during university). Also, I'm from Indonesia, but I'm hoping to get Australian citizenship one day.</p>
  <p>My native language is Indonesian, but I can speak about 3 other languages, if you count dialects (Bahasa Sunda and Bahasa Jawa) as a language that is, because although both my parents were born and raised in Indonesia, they come from two different subcultures (one Sundanese and the other Javanese)</p>
  <p><strong>A little bit more about me</strong></p>
  <p>I'm around 163cm, or 5'4 if you use feet, I'm deathly allergic to cats, I owned a tiny pet spider once, and I've got a deep love for gaming, drawing, anime, and cooking shows! (and sometimes, the irl cooking)</p>
  <p>Although I don't play games as often as I used to, I'm still very fond of life simulation and sandbox games, from games like Harvest Moon (very nostalgic, I had it on my PSP at age 5) to games like Minecraft (been playing from 2010) or Sims 4 and Spore. I prefer soothing games over violent ones, though I do commit a fair share of war crimes and murder in The Sims.</p>
  <p>My passion for drawing and anime is somewhat intertwined, since the only things I draw are just, cute chibi fanarts of animes I've watched, animes like SpyxFamily, Food Wars, K-On!! and Poco's Udon World and so on. The only reason I dont pursue art as a major is because art is a past time, not something I would want to do as a job.</p>
  <p>Now onto cooking shows! I've always been a foodie; I love to eat all sorts of food and I love to watch people cook all sorts of things. It's quite therapeutic to watch people cook, frankly, but not as enjoyable when I'm the one doing the cooking myself because I hate doing the dishes :(</p>
  <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
  <p><strong>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</strong></p>
  <p>Throughout my life, I have always been exposed to the latest technologies due to my dad's job, but my interest in IT didn't begin until about 9th grade, when I became fascinated by how rapid developments in IT affect people's lives. Everything from apps that organize your schedule to online shopping apps, the little things that make life more convenient, especially for those who are disabled, or lazy, or pressed for time&hellip; Or all of the above.</p>
  <p>I also became interested in IT because of gaming and the idea that you could make any game you want if you knew how to do it, so I've always wanted to make a type of open world RPG game based on Indonesian folktale and legends.</p>
  <p><strong>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</strong></p>
  <p>Both my father, and this Indonesian app called Go-Jek, if it weren't for my father, I probably wouldn't be interested in IT in the first place, but the app is just, really amazing, it had everything all in one app and by everything I mean <em>*everything*</em>.The app offers everything from an e-wallet, a package delivery service, online shopping, food delivery, massage, and even full-service house cleaning. It's like a Mega App with everything you could possibly need, and I absolutely love it.</p>
