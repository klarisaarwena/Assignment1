  <p><strong>An Introduction</strong></p>

  <p>Hi, Hello and Good day, my name is Klarisa Arwena Anhar, and I'm a student in RMIT, I'm 18 years old &ndash; born on 1st of April 2004 &ndash; and I'm pursuing a degree in Information Technology, I graduated from high school not too long ago, so my educational background is limited (though I look forward to learning many new things during university). Also, I'm from Indonesia, but I'm hoping to get Australian citizenship one day.</p>

  <p>My native language is Indonesian, but I can speak about 3 other languages, if you count dialects (Bahasa Sunda and Bahasa Jawa) as a language that is, because although both my parents were born and raised in Indonesia, they come from two different subcultures (one Sundanese and the other Javanese)</p>

  <p><strong>A little bit more about me</strong></p>

  <p>I'm around 163cm, or 5'4 if you use feet, I'm deathly allergic to cats, I owned a tiny pet spider once, and I've got a deep love for gaming, drawing, anime, and cooking shows! (and sometimes, the irl cooking)</p>

  <p>Although I don't play games as often as I used to, I'm still very fond of life simulation and sandbox games, from games like Harvest Moon (very nostalgic, I had it on my PSP at age 5) to games like Minecraft (been playing from 2010) or Sims 4 and Spore. I prefer soothing games over violent ones, though I do commit a fair share of war crimes and murder in The Sims.</p>

  <p>My passion for drawing and anime is somewhat intertwined, since the only things I draw are just, cute chibi fanarts of animes I've watched, animes like SpyxFamily, Food Wars, K-On!! and Poco's Udon World and so on. The only reason I dont pursue art as a major is because art is a past time, not something I would want to do as a job.</p>
  <
  p>Now onto cooking shows! I've always been a foodie; I love to eat all sorts of food and I love to watch people cook all sorts of things. It's quite therapeutic to watch people cook, frankly, but not as enjoyable when I'm the one doing the cooking myself because I hate doing the dishes :(</p>

  <h2>Interest in IT</h2>

  <p><strong>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</strong></p>

  <p>Throughout my life, I have always been exposed to the latest technologies due to my dad's job, but my interest in IT didn't begin until about 9th grade, when I became fascinated by how rapid developments in IT affect people's lives. Everything from apps that organize your schedule to online shopping apps, the little things that make life more convenient, especially for those who are disabled, or lazy, or pressed for time&hellip; Or all of the above.</p>

  <p>I also became interested in IT because of gaming and the idea that you could make any game you want if you knew how to do it, so I've always wanted to make a type of open world RPG game based on Indonesian folktale and legends.</p>

  <p><strong>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</strong></p>

  <p>Both my father, and this Indonesian app called Go-Jek, if it weren't for my father, I probably wouldn't be interested in IT in the first place, but the app is just, really amazing, it had everything all in one app and by everything I mean <em>*everything*</em>.The app offers everything from an e-wallet, a package delivery service, online shopping, food delivery, massage, and even full-service house cleaning. It's like a Mega App with everything you could possibly need, and I absolutely love it.</p>

  <p><strong>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</strong></p>

  <p>A major reason I chose RMIT is the choice of subjects in the IT course. Compared to other universities I've looked into, RMIT has a lot more options and specialties in the IT field, and the core subjects have a more hands-on practical approach, with more assignments that test your creativity and understanding, rather than a boring, memorization exam-based approach, Having experienced mostly those rigid theory examinations all my life, I wanted to try something new.</p>

  <p>Another reason for choosing RMIT was because of my parents and school senior's recommendation. I didn't really want to go into a university where I was not familiar with anyone, so having at least a few people I recognize within the university is very comforting. (even if they're in a completely different major or faculty)</p>
  <p><strong>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</strong></p>

  <p>If I'm being honest, a little bit of everything. I would like to learn a little bit about programming, database management, artificial intelligence, app making, etc., because I'm still a tad bit undecided about what exact area of IT I want to pursue, so expanding my knowledge and experiencing new things would probably broaden my horizons slightly. I'm sure that knowing a bit of everything will help take me quite far in life&hellip; and land me a decent job.</p>

  <h2>Personal Profile</h2>

  <p><strong>Myers-Briggs test</strong><br /><br />Ive taken the Myers-Briggs test a few times over the years, out of curiosity, and I've noticed that I've been quite consistent with my personality type; The Campaigner, or ENFP.</p>

  <p>According to the test, ENFPs are &ldquo;social butterflies&rdquo; who are friendly, warm, enthusiastic, outgoing, lively, and upbeat. The types of people who love to spend time and make emotional connections with others, and are often the &ldquo;life of the party&rdquo; since they tend to stand out. ENFPs are free-spirits who are strongly passionate with the things they're interested in, and are incredibly creative with their imaginations. Unfortunately, they can be quite a bit too disorganized and overthink because they get too attached to people.</p>

  <p>With all of this in mind, I'd like to say that I'm not really that extroverted, I would consider myself more of an ambivert &ndash; shy with new people but very loud and chaotic with people they're familiar with &ndash; but overall I believe that the test is quite accurate. Those who know me say that I've got a pleasant disposition, with a calming yet chaotic vibe, and it's true that I've got a whole lot of ideas and concepts in my head, and indeed tend to hyperfixate on things that fascinates me.</p>

  <p>In job terms, I feel like this would make me a wonderful team player, since I'm quite good at cooperating with team members, and I'm incredibly open-minded to diverse types of personalities and strive to understand different people in-depth. I prefer not to be a leader because although I enjoy taking charge and initiative with my ideas, I find it hard to put in the hard work when I'm not 100% into the project, and if it goes south, I'll probably overthink it to the point of a panic attack.

    <p><strong>Learning Styles test</strong></p>

    <p>The results for my learning styles test are, not so surprisingly, a tie between auditory and visual learner, which makes sense because I do tend to learn better when people show me how to do things themselves, and I understand things better once I get a good grasp on the concept. Unfortunately, I feel intimidated when I dive head first into a hands-on experience, and I feel a little lost without guidance or help, and that would probably make me a better follower than a leader if I'm being honest.</p>

    <p><strong>Big Five Personality test</strong></p>

    <p>Through the Big Five Personality (OCEAN) test I've discovered that I'm an intensely open and extroverted person, who is very agreeable but not very disciplined, which I'd say is quite accurate.. Except the part that says I'm over 75% extroverted.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>I've mentioned above that I'm mostly talkative when it comes to someone I'm familiar with, but I'm gradually starting to see why I'm labeled as extroverted more often than not; although I'm shy I can still talk to strangers, and I have no problems in making friends or building new connections, mostly because I'm very open with my opinions and I'm rarely ever judgmental. In addition to that, the fact that I try awfully hard to make a good impression to new people would make me come off as agreeable&hellip; maybe to the point of becoming a pushover sometimes.</span></p>

    <p>I'm also aware that I lack discipline from my impulsiveness and extreme last-minute procrastination, but it's something I'm working hard on, and so far it hasn't really affected my work ethic much, because I do get the job done in the end, and I dont mind going out of my comfort zone to try new things.</span></p>

    <h2>My Ideal Job</h2>

    <p><strong>What is my ideal job?</strong></p>

    <p>An area of IT that I'm currently extremely interested in is gaming, specifically designing games and coming up ideas for it, and bringing those ideas to life, one such job that I've found in listing is the one I've attached above, in a company called &ldquo;Keywords studios&rdquo;, a sort of game developing company that provides the technical services needed to make a &ldquo;game idea&rdquo; playable.</p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Link: <a href="https://au.talent.com/w/rnd-templateWhitepage/?platform=&amp;action=&amp;uit=&amp;id=5e985e8ab383&amp;ost=true&amp;source=joblist_partner_bulk&amp;utm_medium=joblist_partner_bulk&amp;ib=true&amp;jobSeekerContext=&amp;np=true&amp;bulkStrategy=true">Job Game Designer - Keywords Studios (talent.com)</a></em></span></p>

      <p><strong>What is a Game designer? What do they do?</strong></p>

      <p>As mentioned above, game designers are the ones who come up with the fun ideas and concepts for games, the ones who develop the characters and storyline and details, and simply bring them to life with the power of programming and math.</p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Source:</em><br /><em><a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/what-does-game-designer-do#:~:text=Depending%20on%20the%20type%20of%20project%20they%20are,Perform%20quality%20control%20tests%20on%20projects%20More%20items">What Does a Game Designer Do? Job Responsibilities and Work Environment | Indeed.com</a></em><br /><em><a href="https://au.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/what-does-game-designer-do">What Does a Game Designer Do? (Plus Common Skills) | Indeed.com Australia</a></em><br /></span></p>

        <p><strong>Why does this job appeal to me?</strong></p>

        <p>This job appeals to me because it implements the creativity skill that I have, and the passion for creating stories and such into a playable game. It's really just something that gets my inner child excited. Besides that, I find that game designers have pretty good pay for a job that seems pretty enjoyable to have.</p>

        <p><strong>What are the skills and qualifications required?&nbsp;</strong></p>

        <p>As far as I know, game designers need to get creative with their game concepts and ideas, something new or fresh would probably do better than an overused game gimmick. However, the job requires a lot of management skills, math (<em>e.g., geometry, algebra, and physics</em>), logic, programming, and 3D animation and art modeling, along with a sprinkle of cinematography and word-building.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>What skills do I currently have and how do I plan to improve?</strong></p>

        <p>I'd like to think that I'm good at producing game concepts and storylines, and I already have very basic animation and art modeling skills from my digital arts hobby. Unfortunately, I feel like I'd have to work on my management skills and math, but aside from that, I'm glad to say I'm slowly honing my programming skills thanks to the professors and lecturers at RMIT. As time goes by, I hope to gain any necessary qualifications that I lack in the coming years.</p>

        <h2>My Project Idea</h2>

        <p><strong>A Small Overview</strong></p>


        <p>I've got a couple of ideas for a project but, one that really stands out to me for this current assignment is a type of Tinder-Discord-like hybrid website, that you could use to make friends from University, a website called &ldquo;TemanUni&rdquo;, or Uni Friend</p>

        <p><strong>Why did I decide to make this?</strong></p>

        <p>Before you think &ldquo;Oh but discord servers exists for this reason&rdquo;, I want you to keep in mind, just how time consuming it is to search and privately message a person one-by-one just to make a friend or acquaintance, especially when you're a shy introvert, or you're from overseas and don't even know where to start, it can be very overwhelming for first-time uni students, even more so for those who just graduated from high school and are moving into a completely foreign country alone &ndash; just like me! :)</p>

        <p><strong>A little dive into what the website would be like, its features, descriptions and so on</strong></p>

        <p>This website will offer a similar matchmaking feature to Tinder, where you list your major, name of university, year or semester, subjects taken, country of origin and languages spoken, along with interests and hobbies that'll hopefully be a fun conversation starter. Once you make your match, you'll be able to chat with them and share your social media accounts with each other so you'll be able to chat more comfortably, the website acts more as a place to meet new people and message them temporarily, so its features are a little bit limited, because I don't think it would need much anyway.<br /><br />To prevent scammers, groomers, predators, and overall bad people coming onto the website, people can only sign up with their university email, a real one, ones provided from their university, with a two-factor authentication</p>

        <p><strong>What are the tools, technologies and skills required to make this website?</strong></p>

        <p>As it is a website, I'll need a good amount of knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other types of programming such as Python, along with a couple of open and closed sourced tools, ones that I have yet to find. Since this website solely relies on the internet and online services, it would need a good cloud service provider such as Amazon web services (AWS). Signing up is required using Microsoft Outlook (or whatever email provider the university uses) and one-time passwords are sent through there for security.</p>

        <p>In terms of hardware, it would be preferred to have a powerful PC, one that is reliable and does not overheat easily, and a lot of backup space just in case anything were to happen. Although the plans and in-depth details for this website are yet to be perfected, I am confident that I can learn the skills that I need to use for this project through RMIT's courses throughout the years of my studies.</p>

        <p><strong>The outcome</strong></p>

        <p>The outcome of this project would be, once again, a place where first time uni students can meet people from their year without the hassle of searching server after server in apps like Discord or Instagram, and I hope that with this website, International first year students like me will find making university friends a whole lot easier. It would take a lot of time and effort in order to make this website work, but I believe that if i try hard enough, I would be able to make it a reality one day.</p>
